                    <h3>Why Going on a Picnic is Good for Your Family</h3>
                    <p>Putting together a family picnic can be as simple as stopping by a local bakery to pick up some gourmet sandwiches and heading to the nearest canyon, mountain or park. Area residents are blessed with an abundance of scenic options just a few minutes’ drive away.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Whether you picnic regularly with your family or it has been awhile since you availed yourself of the opportunity, there are plenty of reasons to go again soon. Here are a few: 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Family bonding</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With so much going on in people’s lives, there seem to be few opportunities where family members can be together and focus on enjoying each other’s company. A picnic provides a perfect opportunity. “Staying engaged with your family and friends can help build stronger bonds and foster warmth, security and love, as well as feelings of belonging,” notes healthfitnessrevolution.com.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Improved mental health</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Research verifies spending time in a natural setting is good for mental health. For example, a study published by the National Academy of Sciences found participants who spent 90 minutes in a natural environment reported lower levels of anxiety and reduced neural activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain associated with mental illness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “The researchers noted that increased urbanization closely correlates with increased instances of depression and other mental illness,” reports a Collective Evolution articleabout the research. “Taking the time to regularly remove ourselves from urban settings and spend more time in nature can greatly benefit our psychological (and physical) well-being.”

                    <strong>Eating together helps children</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Numerous studies demonstrate a positive connection between family meals and better behavior by children. As USA Today explains, family dinners appear to help children avoid risky behaviors and might even improve school performance.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Build traditions</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Children want to feel they belong to something. They also feel secure with familiarity and routine. When parents establish family rituals such as summer picnics in the mountains, it creates a sense of belonging and emotional support. In his book "The Intentional Family: Simple Rituals to Strengthen Family Ties," William Doherty, director of marriage and family therapy at the University of Minnesota, explains family traditions help children build a set of values they can use throughout their lives.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Escape electronic distractions</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When computers, phones, tablets and other electronic devices have too much going on, their systems benefit from a reboot. The same is true for people of all ages. Too many activities and too much stress can bog down minds and spirits. A picnic up a canyon without cellphones or other electronics is a great way to connect with your internal operating system and to reboot your energy and intellect.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Make it easy</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The best picnics are simple. Instead of trying to cook a meal on a dirty charcoal stove at a designated picnic site, opt for precooked foods you can eat with your hands. One idea would be to visit a local bakery for delicious breads, rolls and desserts. Add some cheese, fresh fruits and vegetables, and you have a meal that will satisfy most family members. If you want something more substantial, many of those bakeries also offer specialty sandwiches you don’t have to make yourself. Either way it’s a meal that doesn’t require lots of preparation or cleanup.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With warmer, beautiful weather finally here, this is the perfect time to treat yourself and your family to an outdoor eating experience. Make a commitment to go often this summer and see if you don’t reap some great benefits as a result.
